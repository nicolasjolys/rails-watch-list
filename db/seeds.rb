# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)require 'faker'

# require 'faker'


# puts "Cleaning database..."
# # Movie.destroy_all

# puts "Creating 12 movies..."

# 12.times do
#   movie = Movie.new(
#     title:    Faker::Movie.title,
#     overview: Faker::Movies::BackToTheFuture.quote,
#     poster_url: Faker::Internet.url(host: 'movies.com'),
#     rating: rand(5..10).to_f,
#   )
#   movie.save!
# end
# puts 'Finished!'
